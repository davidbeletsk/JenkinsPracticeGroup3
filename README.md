LOOPACADEMY Testing Framework
Overview
The LOOPACADEMY Testing Framework is an advanced, Java-based automation framework developed by the students of LOOPACADEMY. Designed for both UI and API testing, this framework integrates database interactions seamlessly, ensuring comprehensive validation of web applications' functionality, performance, and security. Built on Maven, it facilitates easy management of project dependencies and customizable build configurations.

Key Features
Modular Page Package: Implements the Page Object Model (POM) for encapsulating UI behavior and elements, promoting code reuse and maintainability.
Test Runner: Utilizes JUnit's advanced runner capabilities for flexible execution strategies, tagging, and filtering.
Step Definitions: Employs Cucumber for BDD approach, enhancing the documentation and readability of test cases.
Utilities Module: Offers a suite of utilities for common tasks such as screenshot capture, logging, and data manipulation, designed for extensibility.
Feature Files Repository: Organized BDD feature files for clear, human-readable test scenario outlines.
Database Testing: Integrates JDBC and ORM solutions for robust database state validation and manipulation.
RESTful API Testing: Incorporates RestAssured for fluent API test scripting, supporting a wide range of HTTP operations.
Technical Prerequisites
JDK 11 or above
Maven 3.6.3 or later
Any IDE that supports Java and Maven (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)
Setup Instructions
Environment Setup
Install Java JDK: Ensure Java JDK 11+ is installed and JAVA_HOME is configured.
Install Maven: Download and install Apache Maven, setting up the M2_HOME path.
Project Setup
Clone the Project:


git clone https://github.com/dinara0512/Group3JenkinsPractice
cd your-framework-repo
Install Project Dependencies:


mvn clean install
IDE Configuration: Import the project into your IDE as a Maven project. Ensure the IDE is configured to use the JDK version you've installed.

Advanced Usage
Custom Configurations
Database Configurations: Customize database connections in src/main/resources/database.properties. Supports multiple DB environments.

API Testing Configurations: Adjust base URI, timeout settings, and authentication details in src/main/resources/api.properties.

Extending the Framework
Adding New Utilities: Implement utility classes in the src/main/java/utilities directory. Use the Singleton pattern for utility classes where appropriate.

Custom Page Factory: Enhance the Page Object handling by introducing dynamic element locators and custom waits in the Page Factory module.

Integration with CI/CD
Maven Integration: Utilize Maven profiles and properties to customize test executions for different environments.
Jenkins Pipeline: Configure a Jenkinsfile to automate the execution of tests as part of your CI/CD pipeline, leveraging Maven goals.
